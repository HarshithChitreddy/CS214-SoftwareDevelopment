# PA7 - Evaluating Clusters

# Task 
As in PA6, your PA7 program will take three arguments. The first two are the same as the 
arguments to PA6: a single file containing a list of filenames of depth images, and the number of 
clusters K (an integer between 1 and N, where N is the number of files in the first argument). 
Also as in PA6, the third argument is an integer indicating which similarity measure should be 
used to cluster the depth images. This time, however, the method indicator is an integer between 
1 and 4 (inclusive), as we are adding a fourth similarity measure. 

The output is very different in PA7, however. Whereas in PA6 you output the result of clustering, 
in PA7 you will measure and output the quality of the clustering algorithm. You can do this 
because every depth image has a “ground truth” category, and this category is embedded in the 
image’s filename. In particular, every image filename will be of the form classX_#.pgm, where X 
is an integer that serves as the category name (# is just an arbitrary number, designed to make the 
file names unique). A good clustering algorithm will put all the images from the same category 
into a single cluster; a bad clustering algorithm mixes them up. 

To measure the quality of a single cluster, you first look at the file names in the cluster and select 
the dominant (most common) category number. You then count how many images in the cluster 
are from the dominant category, and how many are not. To measure the quality of the complete 
clustering, sum the number of images that match the dominant categories of their clusters across 
all the clusters, and divide this number by the total number of images. A perfect clustering will 
get a score of 1.0. Even a terrible clustering will score greater than zero. 

Your PA7 program will read its arguments, and cluster the depth images into K clusters using the 
method indicated. It will then evaluate the quality of that clustering, and write the quality score as 
a single number to terminal.

### The New Similarity Metric
The new similarity measure (to be used when the 3rd argument is 4) is similar to NormHist4, in 
that it is the result of dividing the image into pieces, histogramming each piece, matching the 
pieces using normalized histogram intersection, and then averaging the results. But whereas 
NormHist4 divided the image into 4 pieces, the new measure divides it into 9 (almost) equal 
pieces. The first 9th covers x (and y) indices between 0 and 42 (inclusive). The next covers x 
indices between 43 and 85 (and y indices from 0 to 42). The 3rd covers x indices between 86 and 
127. Since both x and y indices are divided into 3 ranges, there are a total of 9 subhistograms. 

### Output

The output should be a **single** metric, with a **single** value between 0 and 1 .

```
Example for gradle run -q --args="'input_files/correctfiles.txt' '3' '4'":
0.857143 or 0.714286 
```
```
Example for gradle run -q --args="'input_files/correctfiles.txt' '3' '3'":
0.857143 or 0.714286
```
```
gradle run -q --args="'input_files/correctfiles.txt' '7' '2'"
1.000000
```

### Submitting Your Work

Your submission must be in the main branch of your GitHub repository.

### Grading Your Homework

Run your code with the following command:

```
gradle run -q --args="'input_files/inputfileName' 'x' 'y'"
```
We will pull your code from your repository. It must contain, at a minimum two
`Java` files. One **must** be named `CS_214_Project.java`. We will run your
program by starting it with that class name. The second file **must** be named
`CS_214_Project_Tester.java`. This will be used to run your `JUnit` tests.
All future assignments **must** contain these two files, although they may
contain different code as needed by the particulars of that assignment.

~~~~
public class CS_214_Project {
  public static void main (String[] args) {
    // your code goes here
    // You may just call the main of some other class you wrote.
  }
}
~~~~

~~~~
import org.junit.Test;

// other imports as needed

public CS_214_Project_Tester {
  @Test
  public void test1_OrWhateverNameMakesSense() {
    // code for your first test
  }

  @Test
  public void test2_OrWhateverNameMakesSense() {
    // code for your second test
  }
}
~~~~

### Hints

- to the numbers were rounded using ```System.out.format("%.6f",value)``` for rounding.
- the image can't be divided into 9 perfect squares, the third colum and the third row are rectangular not perfect squares.
- HashMaps can be a useful tool for counting frequency for non-Integer objects.
- The calculation for the ground truth can be considered, Sum_of_all_Dominante_Images/Sum_of_Images
- If you want to see the images in an image viewer like Preview replace the PA3 with PA2 (don't forget to change them back or make a copy before running/submitting your code)

### Policies

Three Day late policy applies.
