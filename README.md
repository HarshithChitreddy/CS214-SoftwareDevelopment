# CS214 - Software Development (Fall 2024)

This repository contains programming assignments completed for the CS214 Software Development course at Colorado State University during Fall 2024. Topics included histogram analysis, image comparison, clustering algorithms, and training machine learning models using perceptrons — all implemented in Java.

## 📚 Course Overview
This course focused on object-oriented programming, testing, and software design patterns through a series of progressive assignments that built on each other.

## 🧩 Assignments Summary

| Assignment | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| PA0        | Basic Java input/output and setup |
| PA1        | Generate histograms from input files |
| PA2        | Compare two histograms using normalization |
| PA3        | Compare `.pgm` images using histograms and pixel values |
| PA4        | Match `.pgm` images using histogram similarity |
| PA5        | Cluster images using agglomerative clustering |
| PA6        | Extend clustering with multiple similarity metrics (NormHist, NormHist4, InvSquareDiff) |
| PA7        | Evaluate clustering quality using ground truth from filenames |
| PA8        | Train a perceptron classifier on histogram features |
| PA9        | Combine perceptron classification with clustering for final image grouping |

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Java 17
- JUnit (for testing)
- Gradle (build system)
- Custom `.pgm` image parsing
- OOP, clustering algorithms, perceptron training
